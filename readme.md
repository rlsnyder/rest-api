# Items and Stores REST API

This REST API access a database of Store and Item resources. Users are able to send HTTP requests to the API and get JSON data back about stores, their inventory, and the details of the items of their inventory.

## Usage
As long as I can keep paying to keep the DigitalOcean server online, the URL to access my API is http://69.55.54.76 - I do not have a registered domain name associated with that IP address as I found paying for a server AND a domain name just for a learning project was a bit too expensive.

### Usage example:
Find current store information by going to http://69.55.54.76/stores/ - this returns JSON data and it could be useful to receive that data for an organization that compares prices of items across different stores, for example.
